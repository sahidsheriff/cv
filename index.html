      <h3>Design & Development</h3>
      <p>I started coding when I was 27 years old because I want to develop my own website, and video games from the ground-up. Over time, I have joined a bunch courses online to gain a experience in design and developing mobile and web application. I want to work if not own the best tech companies in the world and I decided to go to school, pay attention, ask people, and do research in the areas to better understand what it is like to become an engineer.</p>
